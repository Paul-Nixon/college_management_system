# **Description** 
My College Management System is a project created on NetBeans 12.0 IDE by implementing Java & MySQL.  

Here's how the system works:   
* Users can register as a student, a staff member, or an admin
* Students are able to enroll in courses exclusive to their respective college, view the courses they enrolled in, and view & change their personal information
* All staff members can view and change their personal info, but only instructors are allowed to register to teach a course, view the courses they're teaching, and view the collegiate info of all the students in their courses
* Admins can insert, update, and delete the info of students, staff members, admins, courses, colleges, departments, degrees, & faculty members

Since it's an open source project, anyone is free to download, modify, and enhance the system. Novice programmers should download it to teach themselves how to combine OOP & database concepts and implement software by employing a GUI. Seasoned programmers should download it to apply their sharpened skills & thereby produce an efficiently-designed product that showcases their tested abilities. Ultimately, software developers, regardless of skill level, who decide to download the software will give themselves the opportunity to develop database, critical thinking, & OOP skills that are desired in the current job market.<br></br>
